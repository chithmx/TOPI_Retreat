## Exercise B: Non-trivial Fitting

Now, we will add an uncertainty to the measurement such that we actually need to fit.
Note that we still assume that we _can_ fit, which is already quite strong.

Specifically, we will assume that all uncertainties are purely Gaussian (i.e. driven by statistics)
and uncorrelated.

The different groups have different tasks, which are discussed on the respective pages:

1. [Programmer](./4-Programmer.md)
1. [Engineer](./4-Engineer.md)
