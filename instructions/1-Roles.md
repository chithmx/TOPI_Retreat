## Roles

Each team will be subdivided into three different groups, which cover different aspects of a project.
You can find similar division both in a physics or a non-physics (but e.g. industry) project.
The group names may give an idea on why physicists are hired outside academia.

### CEO

They will be responsible for the project management, the infrastructure, code reviews, and representation to the outside.
One member of the CEO group is the team captain, who will be responsible for the repository of the team.
This role might have the smallest amount of hard Python coding, but it requires the full overview on what is happening.

### Programmer

They will be responsible for the actual implementation of the program and they will need to prove that what they are
doing makes sense.

### Engineer

They will be responsible for using the developed tools in the correct way in order to solve the actual exercises.
They will need to come up with a suitable presentation.
